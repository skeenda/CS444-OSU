compile with make
run with eat

run the program with "test" as an arguement i.e. "eat test".
The test arguement runs a function that generates 100 random numbers in both ranges
and asserts that they are within the range specified by the assignment.
It also only prints "important" output, who has what forks.
I've also included an image showing where the philosophers are sitting aroun the table
and what forks they are next to.
