\section{Main Point}
The main point of this project was to get us familiar with I/O block devices.
By writing our own disk device driver we can learn a lot about what goes into a block device in Linux as well as other operating systems.
Cryptography is another important part of I/O devices that we must learn how to use to implement into our project.
