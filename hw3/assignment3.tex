\begin{abstract}
In this project we are instructed with creating our own RAM disk device driver.
We must also use Linux's crypto API to encrypt and decrypt our block device.
The device driver must be written as a module that can be moved into a running VM.
In doing so we will learn more about I/O devices and how they interact with the Linux kernel.

\end{abstract}
\end{titlepage}

\section{Main Point}
The main point of this project was to get us familiar with I/O block devices.
By writing our own disk device driver we can learn a lot about what goes into a block device in Linux as well as other operating systems.
Cryptography is another important part of I/O devices that we must learn how to use to implement into our project.

\section{Approach}
Our first step was to gather as much information we could about block devices in the Linux kernel.
We used chapter 16 of Linux Device Drivers as the basis of our device driver.
The next step was to understand and learn how to use the built in Linux crypto.
Then we just had to combine the previous two steps into our own device driver.

\section{Ensurance of Correction}


\section{What did you Learn?}
We learned about I/O devices and how to implement them in the Linux kernel.
While writting the I/O device we learned a lot about how they work and about design decisions that can be made.
Using crypto.h we learned how to encrypt and decrypt blocks of data.
In the process of using crypto.h we also learned how to read and understand code with poor documentation.
Our driver device had to be setup as a module so we had to learn what that was and how to use it in the Linux kernel.

\hline
9:15 Wed, Oct 4 & 7 minutes & Made a script for execution \\\hline
9:22 Wed, Oct 4 & 1 hour & Copied all necessary files and cloned the git directory. Edited the script for correct run. \\\hline
10:30 Wed, Oct 4 & 15 minutes & Started the VM and figured out how to connect to it \\\hline
10:45 Wed, Oct 4 & 30 minutes & Searched for the correct file in the bin to run the new VM with stuff generated from make -j4 all. Made the changes in the script and then ran the vm to make sure it would work \\
10:15 Thu, Oct 5 & 1 hr 45 minutes & Read the little book of Semaphores solution. Began writing with pthreads, semaphores, RDRAND, and the Mersenne Twister \\\hline
12:15 Fri, Oct 6 & 1 hr & Got the random number generator in the correct range \\\hline
13:00 Sat, Oct 7 & 2 hr & Began writup in tex \\\hline
16:00 Sat, Oct 7 & 2 hr & RDRAND and Semaphores working correctly \\\hline
18:00 Sat, Oct 7 & 15 min & Made sure everything is running correctly \\\hline
12:00 Sun, Oct 8 & 2 hr & Added most of the writeup, still need Logs and code section \\\hline
